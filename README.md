# Travel to Korea

Travel to Korea is a website with the purpose of presenting and booking a trip to South Korea.  
On the website, we can find a presentation of the popular destinations, reviews from users, and a form for making a reservation.

## Goal

The purpose of the project is to get familiar with HTML and CSS.  
The idea comes from an exercise from the Odin project.
